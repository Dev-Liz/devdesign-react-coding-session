## Project 4 - Modal Component

This project contains an interactive default button component that displays a warning modal when clicked.

To implement this project, we utilized all that we learnt in **Week 5** classes of the BootCamp.
- We styled components using the modular and in-line styling methods
- We utilized the **useState** hook to manage the display of the modal (set to boolean by default)
- We conditionally rendered the modal using ternary operators.
- We passed important functionalities to child components (cancel and continue buttons) using props.
